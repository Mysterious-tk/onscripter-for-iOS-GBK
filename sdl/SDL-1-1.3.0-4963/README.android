Simple DirectMedia Layer for Android
================================================================================

Requirements: Android NDK r4 or later

================================================================================
 How the port works
================================================================================

- Android applications are Java-based, optionally with parts written in C
- As SDL apps are C-based, we use a small Java shim that uses JNI to talk to 
the SDL library
- This means that your application C code must be placed inside an android 
Java project, along with some C support code that communicates with Java
- This eventually produces a standard Android .apk package






================================================================================
 Building an app
================================================================================

Instructions:
1. Edit android/config.cfg to point to the location of the NDK
2. Run 'make -f Makefile.android'. If all goes well, libsdl.a should be created
3. Place your application source files in android/project/jni
4. Edit the Android.mk to include your source files
5. Run 'ndk-build' (a script provided by the NDK). This compiles the C source
6. Edit project/local.properties to point to the SDK directory
6. Run 'ant debug' in android/project. This compiles the .java and eventually 
creates a .apk with the C source embedded
7. 'ant install' will push the apk to the device or emulator (if connected)

 Known issues
================================================================================

- SDL audio (although it's mostly written, just not working properly yet)
- TODO. I'm sure there's a bunch more stuff I haven't thought of
